/**
 * A fully qualified name represent a unique name of a domain object which include the name of the domain object as well as all of its owners.
 * Although the name typically represent the domain object's ownership hierarchy, users should not use it as such.
 * Typically, Gradle uses the fully qualified name in the {@link org.gradle.api.Named} interface.
 * The Nokee plugins always return the fully qualified name when implementing the {@link org.gradle.api.Named} interface.
 *
 * It's important to make a distinction between the fully qualified name, the partially qualified name, and the element name.
 * The fully qualified name is unique among domain objects with the same base type.
 * The partially qualified name is not unique and includes the domain object's ownership hierarchy from an arbitrary ancestor.
 * The element name is not unique and represent only the domain object's name, without any ownership.
 * Note that a partially qualified name using the domain object as the base ancestor will be the same as the element name.
