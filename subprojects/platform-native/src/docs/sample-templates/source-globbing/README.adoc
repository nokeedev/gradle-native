= {c-application} Custom Source Layout Globing
:summary: Set custom source layout Globing for a {c-application}.

:description: See how to set the source layout globing of {an-application} implemented in {C} using the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: You can open this sample inside an IDE using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

Here is a sample where we set the source layout globing of {an-application} implemented in {C} with no dependencies and minimal configuration.

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.{plugin-name}.gradle[]
----

[.multi-language-sample]

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]

=====
====
<1> Apply the {ref-plugin}.
<2> Set {C} sources to *include* all files with `{file-extension}` extension recursively from the `srcs` directory.
ifdef::header-file-extension[]
<3> Set private headers to *include* all files with `{header-file-extension}` extension recursively from the `hdrs` directory.
ifeval::["{entry-point}" == "library"]
<4> Set public headers to *include* all files with `{header-file-extension}` extension recursively from the `incs` directory.
endif::[]
endif::[]


NOTE: More filter patterns exist such as link:{ref-configurable-file-tree-exclude}[*exclude*], link:{ref-configurable-file-tree-matching}[*matching*], etc.
Refer to the link:{ref-configurable-file-tree}[Gradle documentation for more information].

Demonstration below where we see the {application} builds and runs:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
4 actionable tasks: 4 executed
----

Demonstration when including a file that doesn't meet the source filters:

[source,terminal]
----
$ echo "broken!" > srcs/a_broken.potato     # <1>
$ ./gradlew clean assemble                  # <2>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL                            # <3>
4 actionable tasks: 4 executed
----
<1> Create a broken {C} source file in conventional location with no `{file-extension}` extension.
<2> Rebuilding {c-application} using task `clean`
<3> The result ignores the incorrect *.potato* source file and succeed.
