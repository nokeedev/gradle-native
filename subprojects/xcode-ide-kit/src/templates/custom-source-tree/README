This sample demonstrate custom `sourceTree` in `PBXFileReference`.
Basically, any build settings can be used as `sourceTree` which essentially
creates a reference relative to that build settings value.
To resolve custom `sourceTree` in the Xcode IDE, set `MY_SOURCE_ROOT` to
`$(SOURCE_ROOT)` under Preferences > Locations > Custom Paths.

If you build the app, you will see something different then under `main.c`.
That is because the `MY_SOURCE_ROOT` build settings is overwritten. ;)
