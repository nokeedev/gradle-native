NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a Java Native Interface (JNI) library can configure the resource path of the native component inside the JAR.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are configuring the resource path of a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp}; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.

The resource path is derived from the project's group by default.
For example, if the project group is `com.example.greeter`, the resource path for the shared library will be `com/example/greeter`.
Given the following build script:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.gradle[tag=configureViaGroup]
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::kotlin-dsl/build.gradle.kts[tag=configureViaGroup]
----
=====
====

We can see the effect of configuring the project group:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
4 actionable tasks: 4 executed
----
[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ jar tf ./build/libs/jni-library-with-resource-path.jar
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/
com/example/
com/example/greeter/
com/example/greeter/NativeLoader.class
com/example/greeter/Greeter.class
com/example/greeter/libjni-library-with-resource-path.dylib
----

If is also possible to change the resource path value for each variant as follow:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.gradle[tag=configureViaDsl]
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
include::kotlin-dsl/build.gradle.kts[tag=configureViaDsl]
----
=====
====

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble -PconfigureViaDsl

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
4 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 3 up-to-date
----
[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']

$ jar tf ./build/libs/jni-library-with-resource-path.jar

When the project configures multiple target machines, each native component will be placed inside their own variant aware resource path.
See the link:../jni-library-with-target-machines/[sample on configuring target machines].
