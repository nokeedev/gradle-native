:jbake-description: See how to use the Nokee Gradle plugins for building an iOS application with XCTest implemented in Objective-C.

CAUTION: The following sample shows a plugin in very early development.
Don't hesitate to try it out.
If you encounter any problems, please link:https://github.com/nokeedev/gradle-native/issues[open an issue on GitHub].

NOTE: You can open this sample inside the Xcode IDE using the link:../../manual/xcode-ide-plugin.html[Xcode IDE plugin].

Here is a sample to show how to execute the XCTest of an iOS application built by Gradle inside Xcode.
The application and tests has no dependencies and targets only the iPhone Simulator with a minimum iOS version of 13.2.
