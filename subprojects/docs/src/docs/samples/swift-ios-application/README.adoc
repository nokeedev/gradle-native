:jbake-description: See how to use the Nokee Gradle plugins for building an iOS application implemented in Swift.

CAUTION: The following sample shows a plugin in very early development.
Don't hesitate to try it out.
If you encounter any problems, please link:https://github.com/nokeedev/gradle-native/issues[open an issue on GitHub].

NOTE: You can open this sample inside the Xcode IDE using the link:../../manual/xcode-ide-plugin.html[Xcode IDE plugin].

Here is a sample to show how to build an iOS application implemented in Swift with Gradle.
The application has no dependencies and targets only the iPhone Simulator with a minimum iOS version of 13.2.
