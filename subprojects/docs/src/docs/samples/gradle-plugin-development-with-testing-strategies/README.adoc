NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer], https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

Here is a sample to show how to expand the testing coverage of a Gradle plugin to multiple Gradle distributions.
The project is a simple Gradle plugin implemented in Java with a functional test using Gradle fixtures maintained by the Nokee team.

The Gradle executer will honour the selected testing strategy for the `Test` task.
Read the <<../../manual/gradle-plugin-development.adoc#sec:gradle-dev-testing-strategies,testing strategy section>> to learn more.

To build and test the plugin:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew check

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
9 actionable tasks: 9 executed
----

Gradle executes the test suites for all testing coverage, which is minimum supported Gradle, latest released Gradle and latest nightly.
The reports are available at their conventional location:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ls ./build/reports/tests
functionalTestLatestGlobalAvailable
functionalTestLatestNightly
functionalTestMinimumGradle
----

The build scan displays the test events:

The developer can choose which coverage to execute directly from the IDE:
