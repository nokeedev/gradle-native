:jbake-description: See how the Nokee Gradle plugins can build a Java Native Interface (JNI) library implemented in Java and C.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a JNI library implemented in Java and C can be built with Gradle.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

To build the library:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
4 actionable tasks: 4 executed

The JNI library produced inside `./build/libs` directory:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ls ./build/libs/*.jar
./build/libs/java-c-jni-library.jar
----

Since there is only one variant, the native component is included inside the main JAR:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ jar tf ./build/libs/java-c-jni-library.jar
