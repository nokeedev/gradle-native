:jbake-description: See how the Nokee Gradle plugins are used for building a native library implemented in Objective-C.
:plugin-language: Objective-C
:plugin-language-id: objective-c

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer], https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship], or <<../../manual/developing-with-xcode-ide.adoc#, Nokee's Xcode IDE plugin>>

This sample shows how to build a native library implemented in {plugin-language} with Gradle.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.
