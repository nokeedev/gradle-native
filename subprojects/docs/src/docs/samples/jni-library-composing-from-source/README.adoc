:jbake-description: See how the Nokee Gradle plugins are used for composing multiple projects as a Java Native Interface (JNI) library.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a Java Native Interface (JNI) library can be composed of multiple projects with Gradle.

In this sample, we are composing a JNI library with components implemented in Java and {cpp}; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.

== Project Structure

You can visualize the project structure and layout using the `projects` tasks.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew projects

> Task :projects

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project - The JNI library as the consumer would expect.
------------------------------------------------------------

Root project 'jni-library-composing-from-source' - The JNI library as the consumer would expect.
+--- Project ':cpp-greeter' - The C++ implementation, has no knowledge of the JVM.
+--- Project ':cpp-jni-greeter' - The JNI shared library, also known as the native bindings.
+--- Project ':java-jni-greeter' - The JNI classes, also known as the JVM bindings.
\--- Project ':java-loader' - The library for loading the shared library from the classpath or JAR.

To see a list of the tasks of a project, run gradlew <project-path>:tasks
For example, try running gradlew :cpp-greeter:tasks

The JNI library, as the root project, is composed of four projects.
The following subsection will go through each one of them.

=== {cpp} Library

This library is a pure {cpp} library.
It has no dependency or knowledge of the JVM.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/cpp-greeter/build.gradle[]
----

[.multi-language-sample]

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]

It could be built by another build system altogether.
In this case, we are using the link:{gradle-user-manual}/cpp_library_plugin.html[Gradle {cpp} library core plugin].

=== Java/{cpp} JNI Bindings

The JNI bindings are split into two separate projects.
Each project is fulfilling two sides of the same coin, the JNI bindings on the JVM and the native side, respectively.

The JVM JNI binding project defines the classes with methods marked with the `native` keyword.
We are using the link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_library_plugin.html[Gradle Java library core plugin].

The native JNI binding project is coupled to the JVM.
It uses link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/types.html[JVM types provided by the `jni.h` header].
In this sample, we are assuming the user would have generated the JNI header manually to be used within the project.
It is considered bad practice to generate the JNI headers manually.
The <<../../manual/jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin>> will automatically generate the JNI headers and wire them properly to the native compilation task when both JNI binding project is inside the same project.
See the link:../java-cpp-jni-library/[Java/{cpp} JNI library sample] for a demonstration of this feature.
We are using the link:{gradle-user-manual}/cpp_library_plugin.html[Gradle {cpp} library core plugin].

WARNING: The samples use `Jvm` class, which is an internal type to Gradle.
This type was used as conveniences and demonstration purposes.
It should not be used in production.

=== Java Library

This library is a pure Java library supporting the JNI binding on the JVM side.
It could be any API or implementation dependencies.

== Assembling the JNI Library

To build the library:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
9 actionable tasks: 9 executed
----

All the native runtime dependencies will be packaged inside the generated JAR:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ jar tf ./build/libs/jni-library-composing-from-source.jar
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
libcpp-jni-greeter.dylib
----

The JNI JAR is also registered as an outgoing variant:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew outgoingVariants

> Task :outgoingVariants
--------------------------------------------------
Variant apiElements

Description = API elements for JNI library ':main'.

Capabilities
    - :jni-library-composing-from-source:unspecified (default capability)

    - org.gradle.usage           = java-api
