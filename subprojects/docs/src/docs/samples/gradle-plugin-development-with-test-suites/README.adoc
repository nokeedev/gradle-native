Here is a sample to show how to unit and functional test a Gradle plugin.
The project is a simple Gradle plugin implemented in Java with a unit test using link:{gradle-api-reference}/org/gradle/testfixtures/ProjectBuilder.html[Gradle's `ProjectBuilder`] and a functional test using link:{gradle-user-manual}/test_kit.html[Gradle Test Kit].

To build and test the plugin:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew check

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
9 actionable tasks: 9 executed
----

Gradle executes both test suites, which is a unit test and a functional test, as expected.
The reports are available at their conventional location:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ls ./build/reports/tests
functionalTest
test
----

The build scan displays the test events:
