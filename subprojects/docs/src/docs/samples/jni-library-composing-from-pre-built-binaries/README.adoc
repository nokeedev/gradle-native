:jbake-description: See how to compose a Java Native Interface (JNI) library from pre-built binaries using the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

Here is a sample to show how to compose a Java Native Interface (JNI) library from pre-built binaries.
It may happen that we don't have source code access and all we have are pre-built binaries of the native component.
This sample will show how to use the pre-built binaries with the JNI Library Plugin to compose a JNI library.

CAUTION: The pre-built binaries offered with this sample may not be compatible on your system which could lead to runtime failures.

In this sample, the JNI library's implementation languages are Java; however, this applies to other JVM as well.

// TODO From this point on
The plugin sources the native libraries for the JNI JAR from the <<../../manual/building-jni-projects.adoc#sec:building-jni-variant-native-runtime-files, native runtime file collection>>.
The sample configures the file collection to include the pre-built shared library for each variant:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.gradle[]
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
include::kotlin-dsl/build.gradle.kts[]
----
=====
====

The plugin adds the pre-built binaries to the `java.library.path` during testing automatically:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
----

The plugin also adds the pre-built binaries to the JNI JAR just as it would when building a JNI shared library from the source:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
3 actionable tasks: 2 executed, 1 up-to-date
$ jar xvf ./build/libs/jni-library-composing-from-pre-built-binaries-macos.jar
