:jbake-description: See how to use a Java Native Interface (JNI) library within an application using Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a JVM application in Gradle can use a JNI library.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are using a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp} within an application implemented in Java; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.

To build the library:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :run
Bonjour, World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
6 actionable tasks: 6 executed
----

It's also possible to build a distribution archive:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew :distZip

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
8 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 5 up-to-date
$ ls ./build/distributions/*.zip
./build/distributions/jvm-application-with-jni-library.zip
----

It is possible to use the distribution on a system where the code wasn't built, given the native component of the JNI library is supported on the platform:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ mv ./build/distributions/jvm-application-with-jni-library.zip .
$ ./gradlew clean

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
$ unzip jvm-application-with-jni-library.zip -d .
