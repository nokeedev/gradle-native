NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a JNI library implemented in Java and Objective-C can be built with Gradle.
The library has macOS framework dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

<1> Adding dependencies to macOS framework bundle is done by using the `dev.nokee.framework` group, the framework name (without the `.framework`) and the version is currently infer from the framework
<2> Adding dependencies to subframework is selected by using Gradle's capabilities

To build the library:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
4 actionable tasks: 4 executed
----

The JNI library produced inside `./build/libs` directory:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ ls ./build/libs/*.jar
./build/libs/jni-library-with-framework-dependencies.jar
----

Since there is only one variant, the native component is included inside the main JAR:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ jar tf ./build/libs/jni-library-with-framework-dependencies.jar
