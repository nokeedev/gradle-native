:jbake-description: See how to configure the target machines of a Java Native Interface (JNI) library using the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a Java Native Interface (JNI) library can target multiple machines.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are configuring the target machines of a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp}; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.

To build the library:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
----

The JNI library JARs produced inside `./build/libs` directory:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ tree ./build/libs
./build/libs
├── jni-library-with-target-machines.jar
└── main
    ├── jni-library-with-target-machines-macos.jar
    └── macos
        └── libjni-library-with-target-machines.dylib

2 directories, 3 files
----

It's also important to note that when multiple target platform are configured, the native component will be namespaced inside their own variant directory.
Gradle will also produce a separated JAR for each variant:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ jar tf ./build/libs/jni-library-with-target-machines.jar
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/
com/example/
