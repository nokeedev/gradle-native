:jbake-description: See how to test your Java Native Interface (JNI) library with JUnit4 with the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how to test a Java Native Interface (JNI) library with JUnit.
The library has a single dependency on the JUnit, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are testing a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp} with JUnit4; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.
