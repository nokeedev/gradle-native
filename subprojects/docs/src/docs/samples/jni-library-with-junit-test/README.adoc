This sample shows how to test a Java Native Interface (JNI) library with JUnit.
The library has a single dependency on the JUnit, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are testing a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp} with JUnit4; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.
