:jbake-description: See how the Nokee Gradle plugins are used for building a native library implemented in Objective-{cpp}.
:plugin-language: Objective-{cpp}
:plugin-language-id: objective-cpp

NOTE: Open this sample in an IDE using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer], https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship], or <<../../manual/developing-with-xcode-ide.adoc#, Nokee's Xcode IDE plugin>>

Here is a sample to show how to build a native library implemented in {plugin-language} with Gradle.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy-dsl/build.gradle[]
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]

To build the library:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

The native library produced inside `./build/libs/main` directory:

[listing.terminal,only-if='macos']
----
$ ls ./build/libs/main/*
./build/libs/main/libobjective-cpp-library.dylib
