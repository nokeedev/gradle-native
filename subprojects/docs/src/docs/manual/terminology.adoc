:jbake-description: Learn about the Gradle project's entry point, implementation language and runtime.

Gradle has a wealth of terminology. Here you can find the terms Nokee plugins align around.

[[sec:terminology-dimension]]
== Dimension

Represent a configuration group that hold a meaning.
For example the architecture and operating system are both dimensions of a native component.
All the dimensions are used to create the variants of a component.

[[sec:terminology-entry-point]]
== Entry point

Represent the capability of how a component is used.
A component can be used as a library, as an application, as a test suite, as a device driver, etc.
For example, the <<jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin>> provides the library entry point capability to the project it is applied.

[[sec:terminology-language]]
== Implementation Language

Represent the capability of how a component is implemented.
A component can be implemented in {cpp}, C, Objective-C, Objective-{cpp}, Swift, etc. or as a mix of those languages.
For example, the <<cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,{cpp} Language Plugin>> provide the {cpp} language implementation capability to the project it is applied.

[[sec:terminology-plugin-id-triplet]]
== Plugin Identification Triplet

Represent the capability combination of a plugin across the link:#sec:terminology-language[language], link:#sec:terminology-runtime[runtime] and link:#sec:terminology-entry-point[entry point] dimensions.
Some combinations are also subject to implicit limitation with regards to mixing them with other plugins.
The triplet offers a simple and concise way of understanding when and how a plugin can be used.
Each segment of the triplet act as an opinion for the project's capabilities.
Head over to the <<plugin-anatomy.adoc#,Anatomy of a Nokee Plugin>> chapter to learn more..

[[sec:terminology-runtime]]
== Runtime

Represent the capability of how a component is targeting an environment.
A component can target Java Native Interface (JNI), Windows API, iOS, Android, etc.
For example, the <<jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin>> provides the JNI runtime capability to the project it is applied.
