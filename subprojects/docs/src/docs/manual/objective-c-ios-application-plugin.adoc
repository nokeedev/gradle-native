:jbake-description: Learn what the Nokee's Objective-C iOS application plugin (i.e. dev.nokee.objective-c-ios-application) has to offer to your Gradle build.

CAUTION: The following plugin is in very early development.
Don't hesitate to try it out.
If you encounter any problems, please link:https://github.com/nokeedev/gradle-native/issues[open an issue on GitHub].

The Objective-C iOS Application Plugin provides the tasks, configurations and conventions for building applications for iOS devices implemented in Objective-C.
It provides an entry point (application), runtime (iOS) and implementation language (Objective-C).

== Tasks

=== Lifecycle Tasks

The Objective-C iOS Application Plugin attaches some of its tasks to the standard lifecycle tasks documented in the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin chapter] â€” which the plugin applies automatically:

`assemble` - Task (lifecycle)::
Aggregates task that assembles the debug variant of the iOS application for the iPhone simulator targeting iOS 13.2.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`check` - Task (lifecycle)::
Aggregates task that performs verification tasks, such as running the tests.
Some plugins add their verification task to `check`.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`build` - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: `check`, `assemble`
::
Aggregate tasks that perform a full build of the project.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`clean` - Delete::
Deletes the build directory and everything in it, i.e. the path specified by the `Project.getBuildDir()` project property.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

== Limitation

At the moment, the plugin has the following limitations:

- No dependencies can be configured for the iOS application.
- Targeted iOS version is fixed to 13.2.
- Single variant running only on the iPhone simulator.
