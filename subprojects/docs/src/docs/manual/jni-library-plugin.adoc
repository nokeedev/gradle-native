:jbake-description: Learn what the Nokee's Java Native Interface (JNI) library plugin (i.e. dev.nokee.jni-library) has to offer to your Gradle build.

The JNI Library Plugin provides the tasks, configurations and conventions for building libraries using the Java Native Interface runtime.
It provides both an entry point (library) and runtime (JNI).
An JVM (i.e. the link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_plugin.html[Java Plugin]) and native implementation (i.e. the <<cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,{cpp} Language Plugin>> or <<c-language-plugin.adoc#,C Language Plugin>>) language plugins are required to be applied to produce anything meaningful.

NOTE: This plugin produces a JNI library as JARs using the JNI runtime.
It doesn't provide any implementation language capabilities and thus needs to be composed by applying other implementation language plugins, such as <<cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,{cpp} Language Plugin>>, <<c-language-plugin.adoc#,C Language Plugin>>, <<objective-c-language-plugin.adoc#,Objective-C Language Plugin>>, <<objective-cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,Objective-{cpp} Language Plugin>> and link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_plugin.html[Java Plugin].

NOTE: This plugin is incompatible with the link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_library_plugin.html[Java Library Plugin] and link:{gradle-user-manual}/application_plugin.html[Java Application Plugin].
Those two plugins provide an opinionated entry point (e.g. library and application, respectively).
They cannot be applied within the same project.
Instead, use the link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_plugin.html[Java Language Plugin].
The plugin can consume JVM libraries produced by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_library_plugin.html[Java Library Plugin] without any issue.

[[sec:jni_library_tasks]]
== Tasks

The following diagram shows the relationships between tasks added by this plugin.

.JNI Library Plugin default task graph
image::jni-library-task-graph.png[]

`jar` — link:{gradle-language-reference}/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html[Jar]::
Depends on: All the task which contribute to the JAR library (e.g. `classes`)
::
Assembles the production JAR file, based on the classes and resources attached to the main source set.

[[sec:jni_library_task_variants]]
=== Variant-dependent Tasks

The JNI Library Plugin creates tasks based on variants of the library component.
Read the link:{gradle-user-manual}/building_cpp_projects.html#sec:introducing_build_variants-cpp[introduction to build variants] for more information.

`link__Variant__` (e.g. `linkWindows` and `linkLinux`) - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: All tasks which contribute to the link libraries, including `link__Variant__` and `create__Variant__` tasks from projects that are resolved via project dependencies
::
Links shared library from compiled object files using the selected linker.

`sharedLibrary__Variant__` (e.g. `sharedLibraryWindows` and `sharedLibraryLinux`) - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: `link__Variant__`
This is an aggregate task that depends on tasks for creating the Shared Library binary.

`jar__Variant__` (e.g. `jarWindows` and `jarLinux`) - link:{gradle-language-reference}/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html[Jar]::
Depends on: `sharedLibrary__Variant__`
::
Assembles the production JAR file, based on the classes and resources attached to the main source set.
The task will contain the shared library for the JNI bridge as well as all the native runtime dependencies when a single target machine is configured.
When multiple target machines are configured, a separate JAR task is created for each variant containing the respective shared library and native runtime dependencies.

[[sec:jni_library_lifecycle_tasks]]
=== Lifecycle Tasks

The JNI Library Plugin attaches some of its tasks to the standard lifecycle tasks documented in the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin chapter] — which the <<jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin] applies automatically:

`assemble` - Task (lifecycle)::
Aggregates task that assembles the debug variant of the shared library (if available) for the current host (if present) in the project as well as the JAR.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`check` - Task (lifecycle)::
Aggregates task that performs verification tasks, such as running the tests.
Some plugins add their verification task to `check`.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`build` - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: `check`, `assemble`
::
Aggregate tasks that perform a full build of the project.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`clean` - Delete::
Deletes the build directory and everything in it, i.e. the path specified by the `Project.getBuildDir()` project property.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].


== Dependency management

The following graph describes the configurations added by the JNI Library Plugin:

.JNI Library Plugin configurations
image::jni-library-configurations.png[]

* The configurations in white are the ones a user should use to declare dependencies
* The configurations in pink, also known as consumable denoted by \(C), are the ones used when a component runs against the library
* The configurations in blue, also known as resolvable denoted by \(R), are internal to the component, for its own use

// TODO: Blog why it's preferred to use the `library` extension
To declare dependencies, it is preferred to use the link:#sec:jni_library_extension[`library` extension]:

   }
}

The following configurations can be used to declare dependencies:

`api`::
Used for declaring API dependencies for JVM consumers (see link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_separation[API vs implementation section of the Java Library Plugin chapter]).
This is where you should declare dependencies that are transitively exported to consumers for compile.
Note that only JVM dependencies are transitively exported to consumers.

`jvmImplementation` extends `api`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for the JVM component (see link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_separation[API vs implementation section of the Java Library Plugin chapter]).
This is where you should declare dependencies which are purely internal and not meant to be exposed to consumers.

`nativeImplementation`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for the native shared library component (see link:{gradle-user-manual}/cpp_library_plugin.html#sec:cpp_library_api_vs_implementation[API vs implementation section of the {cpp} Library Plugin chapter]).
This is where you should declare dependencies which are purely internal and not meant to be exposed to consumers.

The following configurations are used by consumers:

`apiElements` extends `jvmImplementation`::
Used for compiling the library.
This configuration is meant to be used by consumers to retrieve all the elements necessary to compile against the library.

`runtimeElements` extends `jvmImplementation`::
Used for executing the library.
This configuration is meant to be used by consumers to retrieve all the elements necessary to run against the library.

The following configuration is used by the library itself:

`nativeRuntime__Variant__` (e.g. `nativeRuntimeDebug`) extends `nativeImplementation`::
Used for executing the library.
This configuration contains the native runtime libraries of the shared library.

[[sec:jni_library_extension]]
== Library Extension

The plugin expose a Gradle extension to use for customizing the library.
The extension name is `library` and is of type link:../javadoc/dev/nokee/platform/jni/JavaNativeInterfaceLibrary.html[JavaNativeInterfaceLibrary].

=== Properties

`targetMachines`::
Configure the target machines of the library.
Each target machines is a link:../javadoc/dev/nokee/platform/nativebase/TargetMachine.html[TargetMachine].
It can be created via link:../javadoc/dev/nokee/platform/nativebase/TargetMachineFactory.html[TargetMachineFactory].

`variants`::
A view of all the variants available for the library.
Each variant is a link:../javadoc/dev/nokee/platform/jni/JniLibrary.html[JniLibrary].

=== Methods

`dependencies(action)`::
Configure the dependencies of the JNI library component.
